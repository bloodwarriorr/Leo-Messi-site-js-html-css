          <h2 id="headeingH2">FCB</h2> 
          <p>Futbol Club Barcelona (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] (About this soundlisten)), commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a Spanish professional football club based in Barcelona, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.

            Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and red stripes, leading to the nickname Blaugrana.
            Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 74 trophies: 26 La Liga, 30 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva Duarte, and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 20 European and worldwide titles: 5 UEFA Champions League titles, a record 4 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a joint record 5 UEFA Super Cup, a record 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and 3 FIFA Club World Cup. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on the UEFA club rankings. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
            Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.[9][10] Barcelona players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards (12), with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including Ronaldo, Romário, Ronaldinho, and Rivaldo. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta, and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record number (8) of European Golden Shoe awards.
            Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice. The highest paid sports team in the world, in November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year</p>

                <img src="images/Joan_Gamper.jpg" >      
            </div>
            <p>
              Founder of the Club Joan Gamper was the driving force behind FC Barcelona in its first 25 years of existence.
              FC Barcelona, founded in 1899 by a group of young foreigners living in Barcelona, was the result of the increasing popularity of football, and other British sports, across Europe. These origins have conferred upon the Club its intercultural identity, multi-sport focus and its deeply-rooted allegiance to Barcelona and Catalonia. The foundation of the Club coincided with a time when people were becoming interested in playing sport in Catalonia; this social context and Catalonia’s idiosyncratic culture led to the creation of a new model of modern leisure. Gamper, the Club’s founder, was the inspiration and driving force behind the Club’s first 25 years. His commitment to FC Barcelona went far beyond his role as player, director and president.
      
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE CLUB'S FOUNDATION</h2>
            <p>
              Hans Gamper (Winterthur, Switzerland,1877 – Barcelona, 1930) arrived in Barcelona in 1898 for professional reasons.During his free time, he played football with a group of friends in Bonanova.

In October 1899, Gamper placed an advert in Los Deportes magazine to find players interested in forming a football team.

On 29 November, Gamper and eleven other men (Otto Kunzle and Walter Wild from Switzerland; John and William Parsons from England; Otto Maier from Germany; and Lluís d’Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol and Josep Llobet from Catalonia) came together at the Solé Gymnasium to form an association that would bear the city’s name and coat of arms: Futbol Club Barcelona.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> GAMPER AND BARÇA'S FOUNDING VALUES</h2>
            <p>
              Gamper was sports fanatic - aside from football, he participated in athletics, cycling, rugby and golf - and he considered it a vital factor in bringing out the best in man himself. 

He aimed to create an organisation that was open to everyone, regardless of their origin. He envisaged a club that served as a means of social integration, in which everyone could speak their mind, and he created a democratic society that was freely governed by its members. As a sign of his gratitude to Catalonia, the country that had welcomed him, Gamper imbued FC Barcelona with the essence that has come to define it ever since: its commitment to Catalan identity.

Catalan identity, democracy, multiple sports and universality: today, Gamper’s original values continue to give Barça meaning.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE FIRST CLUB BADGE</h2>
            <p>
              FC Barcelona decided to use the same badge as the city of Barcelona in a show of solidarity with the city that played host the new sports' club.

.In 1910, the board decided that the Club needed its own badge and organised a competition to find a new design and it adopted the format that with one or two variations has survived until the present day. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE FIRST KIT</h2>
            <p>
              At the beginning, half the shirt was blue and the other claret, the sleeves were opposite colours and the shorts were white. The most likely theory regarding the origin of the colour is that they come from the kit worn by the rugby team at the English school Merchant Taylors' school where the Witty brothers, two of the first members of the Club, had studied in their youth. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE FIRST FOOTBALL GROUNDS</h2>
            <p>
              Their difficulty in finding permanent grounds was due to economic instability and the lack of large open-air spaces at a time when the city was undergoing urban expansion.

1899-1900 The former cycle track grounds at Bonanova (today, next to Turó Park)
1900-1901 The Hotel Casanovas grounds (today, Hospital de Sant Pau)
1901-1905 Carretera d’Horta grounds
1905-1909 Carrer de Muntaner grounds
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE COPA MACAYA, THE FIRST TROPHY</h2>
            <p>
              The Copa Macaya was the precursor to the Catalan Football Championship. It was begun in 1900 by Alfons Macaya, president of the Hispania Club, when he announced his intention to organise a competition between Catalan teams. The trophy is an exceptional work of modernist art but unfortunately the Copa Macaya disappeared a year after the creation of the Catalan Championship.

                <img src="images/kubala.jfif" >      
            </div>
            <p>The Club doubles its membership and builds Camp Nou, opened on 24 September 1957 under the presidency of Francesc Miró-Sans
              During the 1950s, the Club’s membership increased considerably thanks to the 'Kubala factor' and the construction of a new stadium that would be twice the capacity of the old ground at Les Corts. The 26,300 members in 1950 rose to 52,791 by 1961, an increase of just over 100%.

Ladislao Kubala’s arrival played a significant role in Barça’s successes, and he became an idol for Barça fans. The team’s victories and the legendary Kubala were key factors in gaining fan loyalty. Barça became increasingly important in Catalan society.

The Club needed a bigger stadium. In 1953, Miró-Sans’s electoral campaign slogan “We need, we want and we will have a new grounds” was decisive in his becoming the new president of Barça. The construction of the Camp Nou was an affirmation of the organisation’s drive towards modernisation.</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> KUBALA THE HERO OF THE DECADE</h2>
<p>
  Josep Samitier, the Club’s technical secretary, brought Kubala to Barcelona. He was a player that would change the history of Barça and who became legendary amongst the Club’s fans. The Hungarian genius introduced new football techniques that had not been seen before, such as curling the ball. The team's spectacular football allowed them to dominate Spanish football and also shine in Europe. 
</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> THE BARÇA OF THE 'FIVE CUPS'</h2> 
<p>
  From 1950 to 1953 the Club dominated. Barça’s sensational line-up during the 1951/52 season led it to win five different trophies: the League, the Spanish Cup, the Latin Cup, the Copa Eva Duarte and the Copa Martini Rossi. The Five cup team had a legendary forward line. This was his team: Ramallets, Seguer, Biosca, Segarra, Gonzalvo III, Basora, César, Kubala, Moreno and Manchón.
</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> THE DI STEFANO CASE</h2> 
<p>
  In 1953, FC Barcelona signed Di Stéfano after reaching an agreement with River Plate, the club that owned the rights to the player. At the same time, Real Madrid carried out negotiations with Millonarios, the team that Di Stéfano was playing for then. A strange federative manoeuvre with Francoist backing stipulated that Di Stéfano should play alternate seasons with each club. Barça went against the verdict and relinquished the player. Kubala’s Barça and Di Stéfano’s Madrid competed for many years for the domination of national football.
</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> THE SIGNING OF LUIS SUÁREZ</h2> 
<p>
  The arrival of Luis Suárez in 1954 would further strengthen one of the best teams in history. He was an exceptional player who brought moments of great joy to the Club. In 1960, as a Barça player, Luis Suárez won the Ballon d'Or. To this day, he remains the only Spanish player to have won the award. 
</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> OPENING OF CAMP NOU </h2> 
<p>
  The Camp Nou building works began in 1955 and were completed two years later. The grounds were inaugurated during the presidency of Francesc Miró-Sans, on 24 September 1957, on the day of La Mercè, Barcelona’s patron saint. Different celebratory acts took place at the inauguration ceremony, which included a match against a selection of players from Warsaw. Barça enjoyed its first victory in the stadium, 4-2. Paraguayan striker Eulogio Martínez scored the first goal. 

The stadium had an initial capacity of 99,053 spectators. The total cost of the Camp Nou was 288,088,143 pesetas. Today, Camp Nou is the stadium with the largest capacity in Europe, accommodating 99,354 spectators.
</p>
<h2 id="headeingH2"> HELENIO HERRERA'S ARRIVAL </h2> 
<p>
  Helenio Herrera’s arrival at Barça in 1958 meant that the understanding of football changed in a revolutionary way. Historic utterances such as “we’ll win without getting off the coach” and “with ten our team plays better than with eleven”, led the team to become a renewed formidable force.

Herrera, known as 'HH', put together an extraordinary team made up of foreign and Catalan talent. The team’s newest idols were once again Hungarian: Sandor Kocsis and Zoltan Czibor played alongside Eulogio Martínez and Evaristo. The team also included local players like Gensana, Gràcia, Vergés, Tejada, Olivella and Segarra. That formidable line up won the league title in successive seasons as well as a Copa del Rey and a Fairs Cup.

          <h1>1988-1996. The era of the 'Dream Team'</h1>     
          <p>Barça win their first European Cup in 1992
            From 1988 on, with Cruyff as manager, Barça came to be associated once more with excellent football and sporting success. The board of directors presided over by Josep Lluís Nuñez focused on building up a team of footballers that would spark enthusiasm and perform well. The Camp Nou began to fill up once again.

FC Barcelona managed to secure four consecutive Spanish League championships, between 1990 and 1994. Winning the European Cup in 1992 was the pinnacle of this period, which was characterised by the team’s one touch play and attacking style and the winning mentality of Cruyff’s players.

Known as the 'Dream Team' of European football, the following unforgettable players went down in the Club’s history: Zubizarreta, Bakero, Begiristain, Laudrup, Koeman, Stoichkov, Romário, Eusebio, Nadal, Guardiola, Amor, Juan Carlos, Ferrer, Nando, Julio Salinas, Serna, Alexanko and Goikoetxea.

Led by the Cruyff-Rexach duo, the team finally drew a line under its troubled past; Barça became one of the biggest names in world football.
          </p>
          <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE RETURN OF CRUYFF</h2>
          <p>
            “I know the Club and I don’t want history to repeat itself. If we want things to change, we must change history”. These words set the Cruyff era in motion, marked by a change of philosophy. The team’s tactics were modified to incorporate the Dutch coach Rinus Michels’s “total football”. Team management also changed, becoming the exclusive responsibility of the manager. With Cruyff, Barça experienced a glorious era. Cruyff’s track record includes one European Cup, four Spanish League championships, one Cup Winners’ Cup, one Copa del Rey and four Spanish Supercups. He was also responsible for introducing “rondos” (a circle of players pass the ball to each other, while one in the centre tries to catch it) into the team’s training sessions.
          </p>
          <h2 id="headeingH2"> THIRD EUROPEAN CUP WINNERS' CUP</h2>
          <p>
            On 10 May 1989, goals from Salinas and López Rekarte led FC Barcelona to a 2-0 victory against UC Sampdoria of Genoa. Over 25,000 supporters travelled to Switzerland to support the team. Cruyff’s new Barça took home the Club’s third Cup Winners’ Cup. After years of disillusionment, fans returned to Canaletes and Plaça Sant Jaume to celebrate the top football team’s victory.
          </p>
          <h2 id="headeingH2"> MIGUELI'S FAREWELL</h2>
          <p>
            Migueli holds a privileged place in the history of the club, being the second player who has worn the Barça shirt most times (553), only beaten by Xavi. He was also one of the best centre backs to have ever played for FC Barcelona. On 5 September 1989, 'Migueli' wore the Barça colours for the last time in a match when Barça beat the Bulgarian national football team. Migueli played for FC Barcelona for the final time after sixteen seasons, alongside legendary figures like Cruyff (who scored a goal) and Rexach.
          </p>
          <h2 id="headeingH2"> FIRST EUROPEAN CUP IN Football</h2>
          <p>
            The dream became a reality on 20 May 1992 at Wembley Stadium in London, when Barça beat UC Sampdoria of Genoa. The course of FC Barcelona’s history changed forever. Johan Cruyff’s last instruction to his players before they stepped onto the pitch was: “Go out and enjoy it”. The match went to extra time after a scoreless draw. In the 111th minute, Ronald Koeman’s brilliant free kick clinched Barça’s first European Cup victory. 25,000 supporters accompanied the team to Wembley. One million people turned out on the streets of Barcelona to welcome the European champions home.
          </p>
          <h2 id="headeingH2"> FOUR CONSECUTIVE LEAGUE TITLES</h2>
          <p>The Spanish League was the only title Cruyff had left to win, having already won the Cup Winners’ Cup (1989) and the Copa del Rey (1990). Barça rose to the occasion. Not only did it win the League — it won four Leagues in a row (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994). The last three were won in the last match of the season. To this day, one of the abiding images of the 'Dream Team' is that of the footballers on the pitch awaiting the outcomes of their rivals’ matches. Unfortunately, run of league title wins came to an end over the next two seasons. </p>

          <p>Barça delight the world with their brand of football that is appreciated by football fans from all over the world. They win three more Champions League titles in a decade of dominance for the blaugranes
            From the season 2008/09 under Josep Guardiola, the team improved even further. Playing with the same style that Cruyff had introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his team around the club's own youth system and promoted several young talents to the first team, and the result was the greatest Barça team ever.
            
            The greatest international recognition of this came when the FIFA Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010 shortlisted Xavi, Iniesta and Messi for the honour, all three of whom had grown up at La Masia, the residence where young sportspeople of all ages are trained and educated.
            
            This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing string of major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World Cup, which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won all six major trophies, something unprecedented in the history of European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played memorable matches and won just about every title on offer. But the finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May, 2011, when the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of. The world's press bestowed praise on this extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible chapters in the history of the game. The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under Tito Vilanova (the league in 2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and the Copa del Rey in another historic treble winning season.
            
            But it wasn't just the football team that was collecting honours. The basketball, handball, futsal and roller hockey teams also won further European titles. Furthermore, the season 2011/12 and 2014/15 ended with a  new record by winning 17 professional titles. Never before had FC Barcelona won so much silverware in a single season during its 118 year history.</p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> THE RETURN OF GUARDIOLA </h2>
            <p>
              In 2008, Josep Guardiola accepted the difficult job of replacing Frank Rijkaard as coach and end a run of two seasons without a trophy. To do so, he applied the same style of play that was used when he was a player at the Club, an attacking philosophy based on passing and it turned out to be a great success.

In his debut season, Guardiola won all three trophies available. After a winning start to the following campaign in 2009/10, Barça became the team of the Six Trophies, all won in the calendar year of 2009. The run of success continued with Guardiola claiming 14 titles of a possible 19 as coach in his four seasons in charge. Guardiola became a reference point in football and his Barça side went beyond the strictly footballing field.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2"> BARÇA WIN THEIR THIRD CHAMPIONS LEAGUE</h2>
            <p>
              FC Barcelona went to the Olympic Stadium looking to claim their third title of the season after having won the Copa del Rey and the league. Guardiola went into the final against Manchester United with several players missing in defence. The Premier League side started strongly but Eto’o’s goal changed the game and from then on Barça dominated with Messi adding a second to make the final score 2-0. On 27 May 2009 Barça claimed their third Champions League title thanks to victory over the holders, becoming the first Spanish side to claim the treble of the Copa del Rey, the league and the Champions League.

            <h2 id="headeingH2">SANDRO ROSELL, NEW PRESIDENT </h2>
            <p>
              Sandro Rosell rose to the presidency of FC Barcelona with an extensive background in both the business world and in football. His first stint in the management of the Club had begun in 2003 as a member of the board under then-president Joan Laporta. Rosell was the driving force behind the signing of Ronaldinho.

Rosell’s candidacy used the slogan "We are all Barça" under an electoral program created after listening to the members for two years. In 2010 he was elected the new president of FC Barcelona with an overwhelmingly successful 35,021  of the votes, the best result ever achieved. Sandro Rosell thus became the most voted president in the history of the Club.

            <h2 id="headeingH2">BARÇA SWEEP THE PODIUM FOR THE BALLON D’OR</h2>
            <p>
              FC Barcelona made history with the nomination of Xavi, Iniesta and Messi as finalists for the FIFA Ballon d'Or 2010. Three Barça players who all came up through La Masia swept the podium. Journalists, coaches and captains from around the world, the elite of world football, lauded Barça’s style. It was the first time that all three finalists came from the youth academy of the same club. It was a full recognition of the work done at La Masia. Three superstars developed at home, instilled with the values of effort, humility, sportsmanship and enthusiasm, were selected as the three best players in the world in 2010.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2">WEMBLEY, AGAIN</h2>
            <p>
              On 28 May 2011 Barça lifted its fourth European Cup. The victory came at the new Wembley Stadium, the same place where in 1992 Cruyff’s Barça had won the trophy for the first time. It was full of symbolism. After winning a very difficult semi-final against Real Madrid, Barça played for the title against Manchester United, who they had defeated in the Rome final two years before. A clearly superior Barça won 3-1 with goals each striker: Pedro, Messi and Villa.

It was a great display of football, one of the best ever seen in a Champions League final. Europe hailed Barça, and the world press followed suit. At the end of the summer Barça confirmed its greatness by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid and UEFA Super Cup against Porto.

            <h2 id="headeingH2">THE DEATH OF TITO VILANOVA</h2>
            <p>
              One of the saddest pieces of news in Barça history was received on 25 April 2014 when Francesc 'Tito' Vilanova i Bayó (Bellcaire d'Empordà, 09/17/1968 - 04/25/2014, Barcelona), a man loved and admired by all, died at the age of 45 after failing to overcome an illness had forced him in July to step away from his duties as head coach of the first team, and just a couple of months after leading the team to a league title with 100 points, a record achievement. Vilanova was also Guardiola's second in command from 2008 to 2012. A totalof 53,000 people came to Camp Nou in the days after his death to pay him a final tribute.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2">GOODBYE TO TWO LEGENDS: PUYOL AND VALDÉS</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2014 Barça said goodbye to two captains. Two symbols. Carles Puyol, the eternal captain, announced his retirement as a player after 593 official games and a career that made him an idol for Barça fans. The most memorable of these were his defensive stop using the Barça shield in a Champions League match, his kisses to La Senyera during Barça’s 6–2 rout at the Bernabéu or when he gave Abidal the honour of raising the Cup following the victory at Wembley in 2011. Puyol’s departure coincided with that of Victor Valdés, the long-time Barça goalkeeper who months earlier had announced his intention to leave the team at the end of the 2013/14 season. One of the best ever to wear the blaugrana shirt, Valdés conceded just 441 goals in 535 matches. Among his most outstanding performances was in the 2006 Champions League final in Paris and the semi-final against Chelsea in 2009.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2">LUIS ENRIQUE: ARRIVAL AND A TREBLE</h2>
            <p>
              Gerardo Martino took over for Tito Vilanova in the summer of 2013 but, despite a good start, the left after the 2013/14 season having only won the Spanish Super Cup. Luis Enrique, a beloved former Barça player, took Martino’s place as coach in the summer of 2014 and success immediately followed. In his first year as coach, Luis Enrique would attain the second treble in Barça history, just six seasons after the first. FC Barcelona won the League, Copa del Rey and Champions League in one magical season. The same team, consisting of top players like Messi, Iniesta, Neymar Jr and Luis Suárez went on to win a total of five titles in 2015, adding the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup to the treble. To that treble the team would add four more trophies the following season: the European Super Cup, the Club World Cup, the league and the Copa del Rey. Furthermore, in the 2016/17 season, the team won the Copa del Rey, their third in a row. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2">XAVI’S FAREWELL</h2>
            <p>
              In the summer of 2015, coinciding with the completion of the second treble, Xavi Hernandez announced his goodbye. The legendary FC Barcelona midfielder hung up his shoes after 17 seasons with the first team. He said goodbye to the Club with an enviable total of 25 titles: eight leagues, four Champions Leagues, three Spanish Cups, six Spanish Super Cups, two European Super Cups and two Club World Cups. Xavi left with 85 goals in 767 official matches, an FC Barcelona record. He left as an inheritance his unique style of football.

            <p>
              On July 18, 2015 Josep Maria Bartomeu won the election for the presidency of FC Barcelona. With 25,823 votes, 54.6% of the total, Bartomeu won the third most voted election in club history. Bartomeu quickly resumed some of the work he had already begun in January 2014, following the resignation of the previous president, Sandro Rosell.
            </p>
            <h2 id="headeingH2">THE ARRIVAL OF ERNESTO VALVERDE</h2>
            <p>
              Ernesto Valverde had been a Barça player under Johan Cruyff at Barça and had gone on to have a highly successful career as a coach. He took over as Barça coach for the 2017/18 season and under him a new era for FC Barcelona began, full of optimism and excitement.

            How many times have Barça won the Champions League?
Barça’s record in the Champions League is one of the best in all of Europe. Currently, Barça have won the competition on five occasions, a total that puts the blaugranes amongst the most successful clubs in the tournament with the Catalan club involved in several of the most memorable matches in the competition’s history.

The first success as long in the making as it was until 1992, a time when the competition was still known as the UEFA European Cup, that FC Barcelona claimed their first victory in the competition on a magical evening at Wembley Stadium in London. Since then, however, Barça have a tremendous record in the tournament having won it on no less than four more occasions in the 21st century (2006, 2009, 2011, 2015), thanks to a unique generation of players headed by Leo Messi.  

Despite unprecedented domestic success during this time, it has been Barça’s success in the Champions League that has won plaudits around the world. Victories in the Champions League have been the key to success in other competitions with the blaugranes having won three FIFA Club World Cups and four UEFA Super Cups.  

For that reasons, the five trophies take pride of place in the Barça Stadium Tour & Museum, displayed in the trophy room alongside the Club’s other silverware. In short, they are the culmination of five magical seasons that we look at in this page about the success of Barça in the Champions League.
